    <p class="About-Me"> About Me  </p>
    <pre class="About-Section"> 
        As a 3rd-year B.Tech Engineering student specializing in Computer Science,
        I am deeply passionate about developing innovative software solutions and solving complex problems.
        My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experience in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java,
        Python programming, and full-stack development with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
        I excel at building dynamic, responsive web applications, with strong proficiency in front-end
        technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

        With a focus on efficiency, scalability, and seamless user experience, 
        I am constantly expanding my skill set by exploring cutting-edge technologies and real-world applications.
        My long-term goal is to become a proficient web developer, contributing to impactful projects that push the boundaries of technology.
        Through continuous learning and practical engagement, 
        I aim to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry demands.
